:	Controls a ParticleSystem component for a given ground material type.

#### Input

Add-on components for processing the vehicle input (throttle, brake, steer, ...)

VPStandardInput
:	Reads Unity's standard Input and applies it to the vehicle.

VPDeviceInput
:	Reads the input from a DirectInput device and applies it to the vehicle (Windows only).

VPXboxInput
:	Reads the input from a XBox controller and applies it to the vehicle (Windows only).

VPCloneInput
:	Reads the input from another vehicle and applies it to current one. Useful for passive
	vehicles such as trailers.

#### Replay

Replay allows to record a vehicle and reproduce the exact sequence.

VPReplay
:	Provides record and replay capabilities to the vehicle.

VPReplayController

#### Suspension

Add-on components for improving the suspension behavior.

VPAntiRollBar
:	Provides roll stabilization.

VPDynamicSuspension
:	Dynamically adjusts the suspension spring in a set of wheels based on the cumulative load.

:	Simulates a sloshing liquid in a confinement tank.

VPVehicleJoint
:	Link two rigidbodies together applying specific constraints.

#### Effects

Add-on components providing a variety of visual and audio effects in the vehicle.

VPAudio
:	Implements audio effects for engine, wheels, skid sounds, impacts, etc-

VPDamage
:	Deforms the vehicle as for impacts. May be configured for affect the handling as well.

VPHeadMotion
:	Implements inertial movement for the first-person view.

VPSegmentedSpeedGauge
:	A speed gauge with different speed scales.

VPTireEffects
:	Triggers the tire marks and particle effects based on the actual ground material and the state of the tire.

VPVisualEffects
:	Provides steering wheel rotation, lights and other visual effects.

#### Advanced / Experimental
