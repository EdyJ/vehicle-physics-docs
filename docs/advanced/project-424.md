# Project 424

Project 424 is an open access collaborative project to build a high performance 100% electric
racing car in the LMP1 category (Le Mans Prototype 1) platform.

Vehicle Physics is the official simulation services provider for designing and configuring the 424.
A special open-access version of Vehicle Physics Pro allows collaborative work on testing and
setting up the simulated car.

[Project 424 on Github](https://github.com/PERRINN/project-424-unity)

Unity version is Unity 2019.4 LTS. Supported platforms are Windows, Mac OS, Linux.

## Vehicle Physics Pro for 424

The project includes a subset of the VPP SDK for simulating the 424:

- Perrinn424CarController
- Drivetrain blocks: MotorGeneratorUnit, Differential, Gear, TorqueRatio.

The source code for Perrinn424CarController is available in the Github project. The VPP SDK is
provided as managed DLL.

## Diagnostics

- Telemetry
- Telemetry plots
- Replay

### Extending the telemetry

Displaying text data

Adding custom telemetry plots

## Configuring the 424

### Drivetrain

Torque and brake maps

### Aerodynamics

Aero maps

### Tires

Tire curves

## Under development

- Adherent tire friction
- Effective rolling radius
- Suspension
- Steering
- Better tire effects (tire marks, smoke)
