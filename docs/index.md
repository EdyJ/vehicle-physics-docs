[comparing with other vehicle simulation kits](/about/comparison).

!!! warning "&fa-warning:lg; Project under development: **Beta stage**"

	**Beta stage** means the project is mature and bug-free enough to be used in actual projects,
	but some features are yet to be developed and issues might appear. Main code is not expected to
	have significant changes. Still, everything is provided as is without any warranty.

	- Some components and scripts are yet to be written or completed.
	- Some features are yet to be implemented. See the [Roadmap](#development-roadmap) below.
	- **This documentation is being actively written and updated.** Some pages are yet to be
		completed.

	**Early Access** to Vehicle Physics Pro is now available with the Professional and Enterprise
	licenses. [Learn more](about/licensing)

Advanced AAA+ vehicle physics simulation

:	Built around an accurate physics solver providing realistic results for all vehicle types and
	setups. The precision of the numeric results depends on the integration steps only.

Modular powertrain design

:	Vehicle dynamics core is implemented with functional blocks with inputs and/or outputs that can
	be connected in any number and combination. Any vehicle setup can be emulated by arranging and
	connecting blocks. VPP includes standard vehicle blocks such as engine, clutch, gearbox,
	differential, torque splitter, and more.

Advanced wheel and tire friction simulation

:	Provides accurate friction values in all situations. All torques acting in the wheel are
	properly combined resulting in accurate tire forces and correctly calculated wheel spin rate.

Realistic and coherent

: 	The underlying concept is a custom vehicle simulation model based on essential physics facts:
	forces, torques and frictions. This model is easier to understand and simpler to calculate than
	the commonly used models, yet providing physically accurate and realistic results.

#### Testimonials

> "As a result of spending few days with VPP, I'm really amazed about how much efforts inverted in
> it. It's just not enough to be a good programmer to provide such a project, I can see a life time
> experience that is modeled into code."<br>
> Fadi AlSamman

> "I am impressed with the standard of detail you have gone into already and feel this could be an
> "excellent alternative Simulation platform to what is out in the market already!"<br>
> James "Monty" Montgomery, Vizuality Studio

> "I tried some of the demos with a G27 wheel and it feels amazing! It is easily comparable to some
> of the best racing sims out there. Also I love that you have real telemetry data which is essential
> for us to use with the simulator."<br>
> "I'm really enjoying your product. Developing on top of it is a lot of fun. The code is very
" readable and things just work."<br>
> Samo Å½eleznik

> "I've played lots of racing games alot and I just played the Ferrari 458 demo with G27 for days and I can say that was much more fun than playing other games."
> "[...] truly more interesting than many simulator games like BeamNG."<br>
> Danoosh Peechgah ([source](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/vehicle-physics-pro-beta-feedback-welcome.381241/#post-2574368))

#### About me

> I started creating this kit because I wanted to simulate vehicles since I was a kid playing with my
> Commodore 64. When I discovered Unity 3D that's what I wanted to do since the first day. But I
> didn't find any existing component, kit or document for simulating a vehicle correctly. There were
> all buggy components, too simple approaches, or too complex algorithms/methods/papers either
> covering isolated cases, or mixing simulation and automotive industry. I had the feeling (name it
> intuition) that a better way of simulating vehicles _correctly_ should exist. So I spent several
> years researching and experimenting with a lot of ideas until I finally nailed it. This is Vehicle
> Physics Pro today: the simplest and most coherent approach for simulating a vehicle while actually
> accounting for all major behaviours and side effects in a physically correct and accurate way.
>
> I hope you have as much fun using VPP or playing VPP-based games as I'm having developing it :)
