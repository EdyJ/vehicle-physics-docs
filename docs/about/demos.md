This is the demo I use to learn and memorize the key aspects of this awesome track in both day and
night conditions. The car is a stock Volkswagen Golf. Not a racing car, not even a particularly
powerful car, so the challenge is driving it to competitive level getting the maximum out of it.
See the _Rules & Hints_ tab in the in-game Help for more.

The demo features a beautiful day-night cycle. Time of the day is accelerated to the rate of 1 hour
per minute, so an entire day takes 24 minutes of simulation time. Visibility is very poor on purpose
at night, so you have to memorize the track as much as possible and drive by using the few
references at all within your reach. Remember to turn the headlights on!

Can you beat the 2:50 mark? My lap record at the time of writing this is 2:45.881.

**Credits:** The 3D model of the Ascari Resort Track is my own adaptation to Unity of a mod for
Assetto Corsa developed by the AC forum member **_liquido_** a few years ago. [Full story here](https://assettocorsamods.net/threads/ascari-race-resort-ronda-spain.235/).
