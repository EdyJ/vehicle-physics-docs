	VPP repositories by email. Please allow 24/48 hours for your order to be processed.
- **Custom licenses available** for teams and organizations with more than 10 developers. Please
	write to [info@vehiclephysics.com](mailto:info@vehiclephysics.com) for a quote.
- Professional license may not be licensed by any commercial or non-commercial entity with annual
	gross revenues, funds (including crowdfunding), or total annual budget in excess of €200,000.
- Enterprise license is suitable for commercial entities with annual gross revenues (based on prior

### Subscription

The license to use VPP is perpetual after the first payment. Only receiving support and updates
requires an active subscription.

- One year of support and updates is already included with the first payment.
- Customers may opt-out any time and keep the most recent VPP version when the subscription expires.
- A grace period of 120 days is granted after opting-out to rejoin paying the yearly fee only.

The subscription fee allows continuous development, feature updates, and product support in the
long term.

##### Germany-based users

- The subscription cancellation form is available [here](https://account.mycommerce.com/SubscriptionCancellationRequest/index){: target="_blank" }.
- Receiving support and upgrades during the first year requires actively confirming the yearly renewal plan when purchasing the license.
- If the yearly renewal plan is not confirmed the subscription will change to monthly automatic renewals. In such case, 1) updates and support will be available only while the subscription is active, and 2) support and updates will cease at the moment the subscription is canceled.
